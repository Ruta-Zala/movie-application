Assignment - React / NextJS Full Stack Developer

Please find attached the detailed assignment which involves developing a React / NextJS web application for managing a movie database. This assignment is designed to assess your capabilities in both front-end and back-end development, as well as your ability to follow design specifications and implement additional features.

We encourage you to showcase as much of your skills and creativity as possible. The details of the assignment, including the objectives, requirements, and evaluation criteria, are outlined in this document.

Develop a full stack web app. The app itself consists of a login screen and screens for displaying, creating and editing movies.
The movie entity consists of three fields:
- title (text)
- publishing year (number)
- poster (image)

You will be responsible for building the front end and the backend API
You can see all of the screens in the design available at:

Note that the design file consists of several pages:
- Styleguide - all colors, typography and spacings are defined there
- Components - components used within the app
- Web - The design for the web app
- Mobile - design for the Flutter developer assignment, but you can use it for the responsive design (not required, but does add extra points)

Please Submit:
- Link to a public GitHub repository of the code
- Link to the app deployed in a cloud environment (AWS)

The completeness of the application is one of the criteria we will value with points. You can also get extra points for:
- Hosting the app on platforms on AWS with best practices
- Mobile responsiveness
- Form validation - showing when email/password format isn’t correct or when API returns an error
- Movie list pagination
- State management
- Localization
- API documentation 
- Creativity - add anything you want to the app. It certainly won’t hurt
